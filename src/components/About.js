       <h2>
        A Student Union is a student-led organisation that exists to represent the students at TUMO Labs.</h2> 
 <h5>Student Unions are powerful organisations, but only have the ability to make changes if they have 
        students who engage with them - so make sure you get involved. Whether that's completing a survey, voting in the elections or standing to be one of the Student Representatives.
        Together students can achieve more.It kind of sums up perfectly what we're about. We are lots of things, but at heart we have a few important values.

We are ...

Student Focused
It might seem obvious, but we are the organisation on TUMO Labs that can truly, always put students first.
 Let’s not forget that.
Fun-We want to enjoy the things we do, and we should all have fun while we’re doing it.
Brave-We should step out of our comfort zone and try new things  even if it might be a bit risky and fail.
Welcoming-We have our arms open wide to any student, no matter your background, culture, viewpoint or needs.
Empowering-It’s not always about fixing student problems, we should be helping you to fix your own problems.

</h5>

<h2>Volunteers</h2>
<h5>The Student Union couldn't run as well as we do without our Student Volunteers helping us. There are numerous ways you can volunteer with us:

Be elected as a Member of Parliament
Apply to be a Class Rep
Sign up to one of our volunteering opportunities such as Freshers Rep or Events Crew
Given the nature of volunteering, these positions are not paid - instead students are giving up their time to help make things better. However, volunteers can log the hours they spend working with us through our Volunteer Hours Log - that way the hours you dedicate will be included on your University transcript as evidence of your experience and the skills gained.
